# [Select Hyphenated](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/335a98ba-7983-4d76-9761-210bce8095bb)
_An extension for Visual Studio 2015 and 2017._

Double-clicking a hyphenated word in Visual Studio only selects part of the word.
This extension fixes that problem by selecting the _entire_ hyphenated word.

Use Alt+Double-Click to get the original behavior.

Works in all types of files.
