# [Select Hyphenated](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=thirdwaffle.SelectHyphenated)
_An extension for Visual Studio 2017+._

Double-clicking a hyphenated word in Visual Studio only selects part of the word.
This extension fixes that problem by selecting the _entire_ hyphenated word.

Works in all types of files.
